      title: Network Analysis
      description: You can add custom columns based on Network Analysis metrics to your nodes table & use this metrics as nodes color or size
      advice: If you edit nodes or links after the calculation, it will become obsolete and you will need to generate it again
      clusters_explanation: Groups the nodes into blocks or clusters by the number of relationships they have among them.
      clusters: Clusters
      degree_explanation: The number of connections of each node
      degree: Number of connections
      relevance_explanation: The number of relations of each node, like degree, but connections with central nodes count more. It is not based on the number of connections, but on their importance.
      relevance: Relevance
      betweenness_explanation: How many times a node is located along the shortest path between two nodes.
      betweenness: Betweenness
      closeness_explanation: How close a node is to the other nodes in the network or how many steps it takes from a node to reach the other nodes on average.
      closeness: Closeness
      coreness_explanation: Measures how much a node is in the core of a network. A node has k-index k if it is connected to at least k other nodes which also have k-index at least k. So, a high k-index means that a node is part of an inner core of the network, made of a group of nodes that have many connections with each other.
      coreness: Coreness (k-index)
      distance_explanation: The minimum number of ties required to connect any node of the network to the selected one.
      distance: Distance from specific node
      submit: Calculate
