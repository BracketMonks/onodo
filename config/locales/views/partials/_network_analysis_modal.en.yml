      title: Network Analysis
      description: You can add custom columns based on Network Analysis metrics to your nodes table and use these metrics to control the color and size of nodes
      advice: If you edit nodes or links after the calculation, the network analysis data will become obsolete and you will need to generate it again
      clusters_explanation: Assign the nodes into blocks or clusters (groups of nodes with many links among them and only a few with the rest of the network).
      clusters: Clusters
      degree_explanation: The number of connections of each node
      degree: Number of connections
      relevance_explanation: The relevance of each node based in its number of connections and the relevance of the nodes it's connected to (whose relevance is, in turn, based on their connections).
      relevance: Relevance
      betweenness_explanation: How many times a node is located along the shortest path between two nodes.
      betweenness: Betweenness
      closeness_explanation: How close a node is to the other nodes in the network or how many steps it takes from a node to reach the other nodes on average.
      closeness: Closeness
      coreness_explanation: Indicates the layer of the network a node belongs to. The layer with highest k index is the core of the network. Layer k includes those nodes with at least k conections to other nodes in the same layer.
      coreness: Coreness (k-index)
      distance_explanation: The minimum number of ties required to connect any node of the network to the selected one.
      distance: Distance from specific node
      submit: Calculate
