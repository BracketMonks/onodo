      intro:
        title: Welcome!
        content: "This is the simultaneous editing and visualization screen. <br/>We will guide you step by step from the empty table through all of its main components. <br/>Remember that you may also begin to work on a visualization by uploading your own data file and that this is a demo: edit as you please, nothing will be saved. <br/>The data from the demo will be lost in time, like tears in the rain."
      step_1: 
        title: Scroll
        content: Scroll down and begin to edit the table of nodes and links.
      step_2:
        title: Create your first node
        content: Start by creating the very first element of your visualization.
      step_3:
        title: Look!
        content: 'Now you can see your node in the visualization'
      step_4:
        title: Name it
        content: You can name your node anything you'd like. For example, Luke Skywalker.
      step_5:
        title: Create another node
        content: A link does not exist unless two different nodes are connected.
      step_6:
        title: Name it
        content: For example, Darth Vader.
      step_7:
        title: Go to the links tab
        content: Let's link our nodes.
      step_8:
        title: Add a link
        content: We begin to shape the network.
      step_9:
        title: Select a source node
        content: For example, you can pick Darth Vader as the origin.
      step_10:
        title: Select a target node
        content: In our example, it could be Luke Skywalker.
      step_11:
        title: Add the type of link
        content: Look out, spoiler! You can write "father of" for example.
      step_12:
        title: Return to the nodes tab
        content: We will further develop our main characters.
      step_13:
        title: Add a description
        content: You may include additional information about your node.
      step_14:
        title: Click on the node 
        content: You will see its icon and the description that you have written.
      step_15:
        title: Categorize the nodes
        content: For example, you may list your nodes as either a sith or a jedi.
      step_16:
        title: Go on
        content: To try all of the network's components, we will load one of our networks as an example.
      step_17:
        title: Open the configuration tab
        content: Here you will be able to personalize the colors, sizes, line styles...
      step_18:
        title: Change the nodes' sizes
        content: By default they depend on the number of links, but you can define a fixed size.
      end:
        title: Ready!
        content: "You already know all the basic steps to create a network. But Onodo offers much more: network analysis, custom columns, settings... And, once you create your own networks, you can embed them into any website."
